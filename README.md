# Face_Detection_Recognition

The approach followed for detection of human faces in images considers face recognition as a 2-D recognition problem.

Face images are projected onto a ‘face space’ whose basis vectors are the eigenvectors(called ‘eigen- faces’) of covariance matrix of image data matrix.

Face Detection and Face Recognition is carried out based on weights calculated by projecting images onto the ’face space’.

READ_ME(Face Detect) and READ_ME(Face Recog) contain the instructions for face detection and face recognition codes respectively.
